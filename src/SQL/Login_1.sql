Without service, your vehicle may shut down unexpectedly or may not restart.'),
('VCSEC_a221','Air pressure below recommendation for tires Check pressure and refill air as needed','This alert does NOT indicate that there is a flat tire. The tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) has detected that the air pressure in one or more of your tires is at least 20% lower than the recommended cold tire pressure. See Maintaining Tire Pressures for detailed information on where to find the recommended cold pressure (RCP) for your vehicles tires, how to check tire pressures, and how to keep your tires properly inflated. This alert may appear in cold weather because the air in your tires naturally contracts when it becomes cold, decreasing tire pressures.','Add air to maintain the recommended cold tire pressure. Although drops in tire pressure are expected in colder weather, the recommended cold tire pressure should be maintained at all times. The alert may clear as the vehicle is driven. This is because the tires will warm up and the tire pressure will increase. Even if the alert clears, the tires should still be refilled with air once they have cooled. The alert will clear once the Tire Pressure Monitoring System detects that each of your tires is inflated to the recommended cold pressure. The alert and Tire Pressure indicator light may still be present immediately after you have filled your tires to the recommended cold pressure, but both should clear once you have driven a short distance.  You may need to drive over 15 mph (25 km/h) for at least 10 minutes for the Tire Pressure Monitoring System to measure and report your updated tire pressures. If you repeatedly see this alert for the same tire, have the tire inspected for a slow leak. You can visit a local tire shop or schedule service using your Tesla Mobile App. For more information on tire pressure and inflation, see Tire Care and Maintenance.');

I WAS TRYING TO DO A U TURN. I VERIFIED THAT THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC, THAT THERE WAS AN AREA WHERE CARS WERE NOT PARKED ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE STREET AND COULD USE A PARKING DRIVEWAY ON THE RIGHT THAT WILL ALLOW MORE SPACE TO PERFORM THE U TURN. I GENTLY PRESSED THE BREAK TO FURTHER SLOWDOWN AND THEN VEERED A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT INTO THE DRIVEWAY AT LESS THAN 5 MPH. I STARTED TO TURN TO THE LEFT WHILE STILL GENTLY PRESSING THE BREAK. AS SOON AS THE FRONT RIGHT WHEEL LEFT THE DRIVEWAY AND BEFORE I HAD COMPLETED THE U TURN, THE TESLA ALL OF A SUDDEN, ON ITS OWN SPONTANEOUSLY ACCELERATED TO FULL POWER (A TESLA X CAN GO FROM 0-60 MILES IN APPROX. 4 SECONDS). MY FOOT WAS STILL ON THE BREAK, I DID NOT MOVE IT AND THEREFORE I DID NOT PRESS THE ACCELERATOR. THERE WERE NO OBJECTS OBSTRUCTING THE PEDALS. IN A SMALL FRACTION OF A SECOND, THE TESLA TRAVELED AT FULL SPEED TOWARDS THE TACOMA CAR PARKED AHEAD ON THE LEFT (LESS THAN 20 FEET). SOMETHING IN THE TESLA SYSTEM TRIGGERED THE SUDDEN SPONTANEOUS FULL ACCELERATION RESULTING IN THIS COLLISION. THE TESLA HAD MAJOR DAMAGE IN THE FRONT, THE AIR BAGS WERE DEPLOYED. I HAD A MAJOR BRUISE ON MY ABDOMEN AND SEVERAL SMALL BRUISES ON MY CHEST. THE TACOMA SUFFERED DAMAGE IN THE FRONT, MOVED BACKWARDS AND HIT THE CAR PARKED BEHIND IT. THERE WERE NO PASSENGERS IN THE OTHER VEHICLES. IT IS MY FIRM BELIEF THAT THIS ACCIDENT OCCURRED DUE NOT TO A DRIVER�S ERROR BUT TO A TECHNOLOGICAL ERROR WITHIN THE TESLA VEHICLE. I FOUND MORE THAN 60 COMPLAINTS FOR SPONTANEOUS SUDDEN ACCELERATION FOR TESLA VEHICLES THAT HAVE BEEN FILED TO NHTSA. WHAT THESE COMPLAINTS HAVE IN COMMON ARE THAT VEHICLES ARE TRAVELING SLOWLY TRYING TO PARK OR MAKE TURNS AT LOW SPEED WHEN SUDDEN SPONTANEOUS FULL ACCELERATION WAS TRIGGERED.'),

THE CAR WAS GOING VERY SLOW AS THE DRIVER WAS TURNING TO EXIT THE COMPOUND THROUGH A GATED ENTRANCE. THE CAR SUDDENLY ACCELERATED WITHOUT THE DRIVER�S ASSISTANCE AND DROVE THROUGH THE TRAFFIC GATE BEFORE THE DRIVER WAS ABLE TO QUICKLY BREAK AND BRING THE CAR TO A STOP.   ELECTRONIC RECORDS ACCESSED ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2015 REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: THE CAR WAS ORIGINALLY BEING DRIVEN AT 4.7 KM/HR WITH THE ACCELERATION PEDAL DEPRESSED AT 2.8%. WITHIN ONE SECOND, THE ACCELERATION PEDAL WENT FROM BEING DEPRESSED 2.8% TO 84.8% AND THE CAR INCREASED TO 10.75 KM/HR. DURING THE FOLLOWING SECOND, THE CAR�S RECORDS SHOW THE ACCELERATION PEDAL TO CONTINUE TO BE COMPRESSED AT 84% WITH THE SPEED INCREASING TO 18.35 KM/HR, BUT WITH THE BREAK PEDAL ALSO BEING SIMULTANEOUSLY COMPRESSED. IN THE SUBSEQUENT SECOND, THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES INITIATED, AND THE CAR WAS BROUGHT TO A STOP A SECOND LATER.   WE REJECT THE DEALERSHIP�S DECISION THAT THIS WAS DRIVER�S ERROR. IN SUCH A NARROW ENVIRONMENT AS THE HOUSING COMPOUND, AND DURING A SLOW AND CONTROLLED TURN, THERE THE DRIVER HAD NO REASON TO PUT SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON THE ACCELERATION PEDAL AS THE RECORDS SHOW � WHETHER INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL. WE ALSO FEEL THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR THE DRIVER TO PUSH BOTH THE ACCELERATOR AND BREAK PEDAL TO SUCH A DEGREE SIMULTANEOUSLY. THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE CAR EXPERIENCED AN UNINTENDED ACCELERATION, WHICH WAS NOT OF THE DRIVER�S CAUSING.   THERE HAVE BEEN MANY SIMILAR REPORTS OF TESLA MODEL S UNINTENDED ACCELERATION CRASHES IN CHINA. WE FEEL THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD WHICH NEEDS TO BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED.'),

HAD BRAKE PEDAL DEPRESSED, SHIFTED MY FOOT TO TAP ON THE ACCELERATOR TO INCH FORWARD AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW, CAR IS ACCELERATING FULL THROTTLE INTO A CEMENT WALL. CRASHED HEAD ON AND AIRBAG DIDN''T EVEN DEPLOY. SAT FOR A MOMENT TO CATCH MY BREATH AND TRY TO PROCESS WHAT HAPPENED. SENT "BUG REPORT" ON TO TESLA CENTRAL FROM THE CAR. THE DASHBOARD HAD PRND LIT UP IN RED AND THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT GO INTO DRIVE OR REVERSE. ACCELERATOR PEDAL WAS COMPLETELY LIMP. ZERO RESISTANCE. THANKFULLY, NO OTHER CAR WAS AROUND ME. CALLED TESLA SERVICE AND THEY TOLD US TO REBOOT THE CAR. WE DID, BUT ACCELERATOR PEDAL REMAINED COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE. HAD TO PUSH OUT OF THE 5 STORY GARAGE AND TOW IT TO AN AUTOBODY SHOP. FILED POLICE REPORT. REPORTED TO LOCAL TESLA SERVICE CENTER IMMEDIATELY. A FEW DAYS LATER, WE HEARD BACK FROM THE TESLA REP THAT SAID THAT REPORT SHOWED NO MALFUNCTION. ACCORDING TO TESLA ACCELERATOR WENT FROM 0% TO 88% SUDDENLY, IMPLYING "DRIVER ERROR." YET THEY ALSO SAID THE BRAKE WAS TAPPED AND THEN RELEASED PRIOR TO IMPACT. THIS DOES NOT JIVE, WHY WE A PERSON ACCELERATE, TAP THE BRAKE THEN RELEASE? SKID MARKS FROM REAR TIRES LEFT ON GARAGE FLOOR. TESLA WON''T RELEASE DATA. WE DO NOT WANT TO ACCEPT THIS REPORT AND THIS IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE CRASH. TODAY THE AUTO BODY SHOP INFORMED US THAT THEY WERE CURIOUS WHY THE CAR IS NOT DRIVEABLE.

AS I PULLED INTO THE SPACE, I TOOK MY FOOT OFF OF THE ACCELERATOR AND APPLIED THE BREAKS. INSTEAD OF STOPPING, THE CAR LURCHED FORWARD OVER A CURB AND A BERM, STOPPING WHEN IT HIT A FIRE HYDRANT, PROPELLING IT OFF OF ITS BOLTS, GENERATING A HUGE GEYSER OF WATER.   BECAUSE OF THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WATER GUSHING OVER MY CAR, I HAD NO VISIBILITY AND ELECTED TO STAY IN THE CAR WHILE ATTEMPTING TO DIAL 911. MOMENTS LATER, A MAN WHO HAD BEEN SITTING IN THE CAR NEXT TO THE SPACE WHERE I WAS ATTEMPTING TO PARK, OPENED THE BACK DOOR TO ASK ABOUT MY CONDITION. I THEN EXITED THE CAR.   I WAS NOT INJURED AND THANK GOODNESS THE CAR HAD NOT HIT ANOTHER PERSON OR ANOTHER CAR. IT TOOK A TOW TRUCK ABOUT 15 MINUTES TO ARRIVE AT THE SCENE. ALL THE WHILE THE TORRENTIAL WATER SURGED AROUND, UNDER AND OVER MY CAR AND NOW FLOODED THE INTERIOR. ACCORDING TO TESLA, EITHER THE CAR SHORTED-OUT CAUSING ALL OF THE WINDOWS TO ROLL DOWN OR THERE IS A SAFETY FEATURE THAT CAUSES THE WINDOWS TO ROLL DOWN IF THE CAR PERCEIVES IT IS UNDER WATER.   THE MAN WHO BRAVED THE FLOOD OF WATER FROM THE FIRE HYDRANT TO CHECK ON ME SAW THE ENTIRE ACCIDENT AS HE WAS SITTING IN HIS CAR. HE SAID THAT MY BREAK LIGHTS WERE ON AS MY CAR WENT OVER THE BERM. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT CAUSED THE CAR TO ACCELERATE BY ITSELF AND I AM CERTAIN THAT MY FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKE PEDAL.  THE NEXT DAY, I HEARD FROM BOTH MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE BODY SHOP THAT TESLA WANTED THE CAR AT THEIR SERVICE CENTER IN VAN NUYS. SEVERAL WEEKS AGO, THE CLAIMS ADJUSTER CALLED TO SAY THAT DUE TO THE HEAVY WATER DAMAGE, THE CAR HAS BEEN �TOTALED�.

TESLA SENT THE CAR DIRECTLY TO THE BODY SHOP. I INSISTED THAT THEY RUN A DIAGNOSTIC TEST BECAUSE I WAS (AND STILL AM) CERTAIN THAT THE CAR ACCELERATED ON ITS OWN. THE VAN NUYS SERVICE CENTER REP SAID THAT THE CAR HAD TO BE REPAIRED FIRST BEFORE ANY DIAGNOSTIC TEST COULD BE RUN. AFTER THREE WEEKS I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM TESLA. THE ENGINEERS REPORTED TO ME THAT THE ACCELERATOR WAS DEPRESSED TO 48%, SECONDS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT AND 98.4% AT THE TIME OF IMPACT. I STILL BELIEVE THAT THE CAR ACCELERATED BY ITSELF.  IT IS MY SINCERE HOPE THAT BY REPORTING THIS ACCIDENT (AND THE SUBSEQUENT ACCIDENT ON JULY 16, 2015) FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS CAN BE CONDUCTED BEFORE PEOPLE ARE SERIOUSLY INJURED OR WORSE.

THERE WAS A JERKING FORWARD OF THE CAR, SO I WAS NOT ABLE TO MAKE A FULL STOP AT THE STOP SIGN. THEN THE SPEED DROPS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY, ALMOST TO ZERO. I PRESSED THE FLASHING LIGHT BECAUSE THERE WAS A LINE OF CARS BEHIND ME AND I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. THE CAR WAS IN ALMOST ZERO SPEED, SO I TRIED TO MOVE THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND PRESSED THE ACCELERATION PEDAL A LITTLE. THE CAR DIDN''T ACCELERATE, INSTEAD, IT TURNED INTO A STOP SITUATION.

THE OVERALL SITUATION COULD HAVE TURNED VERY SEVERE SAFETY ISSUE IF EVER THIS HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY, OR THERE WAS HUMAN BEING WALKING ACROSS THE STREET WHILE I WAS NOT ABLE TO FULLY STOP THE CAR, NEITHER CONTROL IT. I AM WAITING FOR OFFICIAL SERVICE REPORT BUT THE CAR IS CONFIRMED NOT IN DRIVABLE CONDITION.
